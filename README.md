# pytorch_to_onnx_examples


Examples created while training and exporting several semantic segmentation models to ONNX format. These models were trained using the FIREFRONT Unified Dataset and they act as baseline models to the FIREFRONT Fire and Smoke benchmark.

ONNX models trained with the public training set of the FIREFRONT benchmark are available in the releases page.
